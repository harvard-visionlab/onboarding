The only difference is that you wont have to put the keys in the \"Secrets\" manager (skip Step 1 because once created the keys persist on your machine's hard drive), and you only have to do Steps 2-5 once (generally the right after you create the keys). In other words, after initial setup on say your laptop, you'll skip steps 1-5 and just jump directly to cloning/accessing your private repos on your machine."
