# onboarding
notebooks and guides for getting setup with visionlab project infrastructure

## Sign up for a github account
- https://github.com/
- e-mail George your github name (FirstName LastName), username, and e-mail address (e.g., George Alvarez, grez72, grez72@gmail.com)

## Using the Harvard Cluster?
Follow the guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5pgxwn49UbxjI8qboi7puHt8QUUsLemt7BRnW6-AAk/edit#heading=h.etakahhrj6th).

You should end up with a username that enables you to login to the cluster (password + 2nd duo password):
```
ssh username@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu
```

Once you have your username, e-mail it to George so he can authorize your username for access to lab storage, etc.

## Get your aws/wasabi storage credentials
Lab projects rely heavily on aws/wasabi storage for storing/transferring datasets and model weights. Once you are setup on the Harvard Cluster, e-mail your username to George and he will setup your storage access and send you your credentials with instructions on what to do with them...
  
## Using Google Colab?
If you are using google colab for your projects, the following notebooks can be helpful
- signup for a Colab Pro account [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), should be paid for on lab funds
- setup ssh for private repo access [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AaBFZDYizf8mxVZ70LXWmkGznonE9FlA?usp=sharing)
- setup code snippet access [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/harvard-visionlab/onboarding/blob/main/notebooks/visionlab_use_snippets.ipynb)
